title: About me
---

My name is Jung Seok Sung. I am currently studying MSc Business Analytics at Warwick Business School. This will be my first step as a data analyst / data scientist in my future career. This is just a beginning of my journey. Watch me rising, like the sun coming up. **I NEVER EVER STOP!**

The following is the list about me so have a look:

- Korean
- `Hip-Hop` and `R&B` addicted
- Overwatch `Grand Master`, most 3 with `Mei / Anna / Zen`. Then I quitted **THANKS TO** the `Aim Hack Crisis` around season 4 and 5...If you know, then you know
- I am `孤独のグルメ`...
- I will write more if I have got something pops up on my mind

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just have a look [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jungseoksung0617/). It will answer **all** your questions.
