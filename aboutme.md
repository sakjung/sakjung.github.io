My name is Jung Seok Sung. I am currently studying MSc Business Analytics at Warwick Business School. This will be my first step as a data analyst / data scientist in my future career. This is just a beginning of my journey. Watch me rising, like the sun coming up. **I NEVER EVER STOP!**.

The following is the list of my charateristics so have a look if you want to know about me more:

- Korean
- Hip-Hop and R&B addicted
- Overwatch Grand Master (Season 4), major with `Mei`. Then I quitted due to the aim hack crisis...If you know, then you know
- I am 孤独のグルメ...
- I will write more if I have got something pops up on my mind

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just have a look [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jungseoksung0617/) and it will answer **all** your questions.
