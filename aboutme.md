My name is Jung Seok Sung. I am currently studying MSc Business Analytics at Warwick Business School. I am looking forward to have a career as a data engineer / data analyst after graduation. The following is the list about me so have a look!:

- Korean
- `Hip-Hop` and `R&B` addicted
- Overwatch `Grand Master`, most 3 picks with `Mei / Anna / Zen`
- I am `孤独のグルメ`...
- I will write more if I have got something pops up on my mind

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just have a look [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jungseoksung0617/). It will answer **all** your questions.
